  <h1>Help</h1>
  <div class="step">
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>At the end of this tutorial, we will have a simple, web-based ToDo list. The list contains a text (with max 100
      characters) and a status (0 for closed, 1 for open) for each item. Through the web-based user interface, open
      items can be view and edited and new items can be added.</p>

    <p>During development, all pages will be available on localhost only, but later on it will be shown how to adapt the
      application for a “real” server, including how to use with Apache’s mod_wsgi.</p>

    <p>Bottle will do the routing and format the output, with the help of templates. The items of the list will be
      stored inside a SQLite database. Reading and writing the database will be done by Python code.</p>

    <p>We will end up with an application with the following pages and functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>start page <code>http://localhost:8080/todo</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>adding new items to the list: <code>http://localhost:8080/new</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>page for editing items: <code>http://localhost:8080/edit/&lt;no:int&gt;</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>catching errors</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <h3>Install Bottle</h3>
    <p>Assuming that you have a fairly new installation of Python (version 2.5 or higher), you only need to install
      Bottle in addition to that. Bottle has no other dependencies than Python itself.</p>
    <p>You can either manually install Bottle or use Python’s easy_install: <code><span>easy_install <span>bottle</code>
    </p>
    <h3>Further Software Necessities</h3>
    <p>As we use SQLite3 as a database, make sure it is installed. On Linux systems, most distributions have SQLite3
      installed by default. SQLite is available for Windows and MacOS X as well and the <cite>sqlite3</cite> module is
      part of the python standard library.</p>
    <h3>Create An SQL Database</h3>
    <p>First, we need to create the database we use later on. To do so, save the following script in your project
      directory and run it with python. You can use the interactive interpreter too:</p>
    <pre>
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('todo.db') # Warning: This file is created in the current directory
conn.execute("CREATE TABLE todo (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, task char(100) NOT NULL, status bool NOT NULL)")
conn.execute("INSERT INTO todo (task,status) VALUES ('Read A-byte-of-python to get a good introduction into Python',0)")
conn.execute("INSERT INTO todo (task,status) VALUES ('Visit the Python website',1)")
conn.execute("INSERT INTO todo (task,status) VALUES ('Test various editors for and check the syntax highlighting',1)")
conn.execute("INSERT INTO todo (task,status) VALUES ('Choose your favorite WSGI-Framework',0)")
conn.commit()
    </pre>
    <p>This generates a database-file <cite>todo.db</cite> with tables called <code><span>todo</code> and three columns
      <code><span>id</code>, <code><span>task</code>, and <code><span>status</code>. <code><span>id</code> is a unique
      id for each row, which is used
      later on to reference the rows. The column <code><span>task</code> holds the text which describes the task, it
      can be max 100 characters long. Finally, the column <code><span>status</code> is used to mark a task as open
      (value 1) or
      closed (value 0).</p>
